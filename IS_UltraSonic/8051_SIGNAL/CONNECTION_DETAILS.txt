J1(Rectangular Header)
======================

The pin configuration is as follows for the Header

2.  RX   -> To receive frequency data from Arduino or other MC
4.  TX   -> Not actually required but for future use.
6.  INT0 -> The interrupt pin which must be set low to enable Serial communication with the 8051
8.  VCC  -> Power supply
10. GND  -> Ground
12. OUT1 -> Connect to X1 of AD633JN(Analog Multiplier).
14. OUT2 -> Connect to Y1 of AD633JN(Analog Multiplier).

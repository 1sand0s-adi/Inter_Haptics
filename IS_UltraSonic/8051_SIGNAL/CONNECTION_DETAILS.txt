The following link is to my PCB web account which contains the PCB LAYOUT for the 8051 Signal Generator

J1(Rectangular Header)
======================

The pin configuration is as follows for the Header

2.  RX   -> To receive frequency data from Arduino or other MC
4.  TX   -> Not actually required but for future use.
6.  INT0 -> The interrupt pin which must be set low to enable Serial communication with the 8051
8.  VCC  -> Power supply
10. GND  -> Ground
12. OUT1 -> Connect to X1 of AD633JN(Analog Multiplier).
14. OUT2 -> Connect to Y1 of AD633JN(Analog Multiplier).

Since ATMEL's AT89C51 can work with a maximum crystal frequency of 24MHz the time per machine cycle will be around 
0.5us(micro second) which implies that since a complete sine wave will take about 25 individual values to be loaded to the port 
and each loading step taking an average of 15 machine cycles(7.5 microseconds) , the max frequency that can be generated will 
be around 5.3KHz . Therefore this will have to be increased atleast 10 fold for which we employ PLL(Phase locked loop) with 
divide by 10 counter to latch the output frequency to 1/10th of the input(source) frequency. 
             The same applies for the low frequency which again is limited to 300Hz therefore requiring another frequency
division by atleast 10 fold.

# Inter_Haptics

This project basically tries to implement a system wherein things that appear in Virtual reality devices like 
Hololens,Occulus etc can be felt . It revolves around adding tactile perception to virtual reality by using 
Ultrasonic transducers.By manipulating their phase and amplitude it is possible to create a pressure point in
space which can be felt by human hands and hence the space can be scanned pretty much like a CRT scanning the TV
screen to simulate texture ,shape etc.
